## Data
The datasets used for this paper are public crime datasets:
 - [San Francisco (SF)](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-ReportsHistorical-2003/tmnf-yvry)
 - [Vancouver (VAN)](https://geodash.vpd.ca/opendata/)

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [saved models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pWygcR5JDdoa-o9p9Qppsu52KYTPZJfI?usp=sharing) trained on SF and VAN public crime data.
